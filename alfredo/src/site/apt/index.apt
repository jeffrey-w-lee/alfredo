Alfredo, Java HTTP SPNEGO

   Alfredo is a Java library consisting of a client and a server components to enable Kerberos SPNEGO
   authentication for HTTP.

   Alfredo also supports additional authentication mechanisms on the client and the server side via
   2 simple interfaces.

* How Does Alfredo Works?

  Alfredo forces authentication on protected resources, once authentiation has been established it
  sets a signed HTTP Cookie that contains an authentication token with the user name, user principal,
  authentication type and expiration time.

  Subsequent HTTP client requests presenting the signed HTTP Cookie have access to the protected
  resources until the authentication token expires.
